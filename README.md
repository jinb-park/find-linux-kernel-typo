# find-linux-kernel-typo

Find a new typo in linux kernel.
New typo means a typo not included in linux/scripts/spelling.txt
(spelling.txt is typo dictionary for linux kernel)

## gen_typo.py

Generate new typo.
In other words, generate new typo not included in linux/scripts/spelling.txt.

It is generated by automatical way.
The way is as follows.

1) Analyze typo's pattern in linux/scripts/spelling.txt
2) Apply typo's pattern to correct word. In other words, Generate new typo by existing typo's pattern.

## search_typo.py

Search typo generated by gen_typo.py whether it is exist in linux kernel, or not.

## usage

* generate new typo
```
python gen_typo.py [dict file] [typo file] [result file]
eg) python gen_typo.py dict.txt /home/user/linux-next/scritps/spelling.txt new_typo.txt
```
new_typo.txt is result file. The file has new generated typos like belows.

```
abbrevieated||abbreviated
abseence||absence
...
```

* search new typo
```
python search_typo.py [linux kernel path] [new typo file] [result file]
eg) python search_typo.py /home/user/linux-next/drivers/ new_typo.txt ret.txt
```

Final result (ret.txt) is as follows.
```
[ detected typo list ]  ==> Below new typos are exist in linux kernel!!
transitition
contants
...
...

[ rank ]  ==> order by how many files include a specific typo
6 compatibitlty
6 poitner
....
....
```

## future work

1. There are some false positive. I have to fix it.
2. It is too slow to search entire linux kernel code. Better performance should be needed.
3. Source of gen_typo.py is from spelling.txt's correction word. Extend source to all correction word.
